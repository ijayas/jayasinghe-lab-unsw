Our team is pleased to share one of our latest projects in using a 3D printable microplate systems for (a) reducing the manual handling of hydrogels, (b) improving throughput, and (c) enabling convenient distortion checking of expansion microscopy (ExM) samples, particularly 4x (pro-) ExM. The idea of moving to a plate/array-based system is emerging fast; it comes from the slightly uncomfortable observation of the level of skill and care required to handle gels during an ExM protocol. These skills are absolutely trainable, a fact that is reinforced time and time again by hundreds of world class research groups that now use ExM to study the structure of complex samples. So many areas of the Life Sciences leverage plain skill and dexterity of researchers in preparing the primary samples and materials for the research. From the point of view of improving accessibility and reproducibility however, particular if you watch any of the practical demos of ExM, the careful handling of the gels (see video demo by the Synthetic Neurobiology Group) can be seen as less than ideal. If the structures that you aim to visualise are at the very bottom surface of the cells, handling and transferring the gel during the ExM protocol needs to be done with extreme care.
