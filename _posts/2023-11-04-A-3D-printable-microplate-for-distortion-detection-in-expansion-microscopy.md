Our team is pleased to share one of our latest projects in using a 3D printable microplate systems for (a) reducing the manual handling of hydrogels, (b) improving throughput, and (c) enabling convenient distortion checking of expansion microscopy (ExM) samples, particularly 4x (pro-) ExM. The idea of moving to a plate/array-based system is emerging fast; it comes from the slightly uncomfortable observation of the level of skill and care required to handle gels during an ExM protocol. These skills are absolutely trainable, a fact that is reinforced time and time again by hundreds of world class research groups that now use ExM to study the structure of complex samples. So many areas of the Life Sciences leverage plain skill and dexterity of researchers in preparing the primary samples and materials for the research. From the point of view of improving accessibility and reproducibility however, particular if you watch any of the practical demos of ExM, the careful handling of the gels see [video demo by the Synthetic Neurobiology Group](https://youtu.be/OksNCAJwxVI?si=uzPSKXGk9Q9cmv5_) can be seen as less than ideal. If the structures that you aim to visualise are at the very bottom surface of the cells, handling and transferring the gel during the ExM protocol needs to be done with extreme care.

The concept is straightforward. To avoid picking up, transferring and cutting the gel, one needs a microscopy-ready chamber that can allow the casting of the gel within a mould. Removing the mould then allows the sample to expand into the rest of the well. If one makes the well a predictable shape with limited rotational symmetries, the orientation of the gel can be preserved from the beginning of the experiment to the post-ExM structure. Use a microplate that combine eight of these chamber units, and you get a multi-sample array that can fit on any standard microscope stage.
