My doctoral studies (2016-2021) at the University of Leeds were funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) through the Discovery Medicine North Doctoral Training Partnership (DiMeN DTP). During my PhD I applied expansion microscopy to cardiac samples yielding the first in situ visualisation of individual ryanodine receptor phosphorylation and revealing cluster remodelling during heart failure. I previously completed an MPhil in Adaptive Organismal Biology at the University of Manchester (2015-2016), where I used electron tomography to evaluate calcium release units in the avian heart. My earliest university training included a BSc in Biological Sciences at the University of Leeds (2011-2015). In my current work as a postdoc the University of Sheffield (2021-present), I have used expansion microscopy to image subcellular structures in a number of life science projects, and evaluated a catalogue of proteome-staining NHS esters. Outside of the lab, I love hiking, running and live music.
