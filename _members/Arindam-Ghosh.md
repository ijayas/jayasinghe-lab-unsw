I develop advanced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy technologies aimed at answering biomedical/biological research questions down to cellular, sub-cellular, and molecular scales. During my Doctoral dissertation (2016-2020) with Jörg Enderlein at the University of Göttingen, I was at the forefront of inventing graphene-induced energy transfer (GIET) imaging for localizing single fluorescent molecules with sub-nanometer precision along the axial dimension. Alongside, I utilized fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and many of its advanced variants for investigating fast temporal dynamics in proteins. Since July 2021, I have been working with Markus Sauer at the University of Würzburg as a postdoctoral researcher. I have  developed a speed-optimized variant of DNA-PAINT imaging which enables ~15× faster single-molecule localization. Furthermore, I extended DNA-PAINT to volumetric imaging in combination with lattice light-sheet microscopy for discerning nanoscale organization of cell membrane receptors. I will be joining Izzy Jayasinghe’s research group as a Senior Postdoc starting from September 2024 where I will be largely involved in implementing multiplexed single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and expansion microscopy (ExM) for quantitative visualization of sub-cellular receptor organization at the molecular scale. Outside the lab, I take great interest in cooking, cricket, and football.
