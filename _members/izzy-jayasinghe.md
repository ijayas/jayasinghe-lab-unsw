I completed my university studies (BSc. 1st class Hons with a major in Cardiovascular Biology and PhD in Physiology) in the University of Auckland, New Zealand. My postdoctoral trainings were in the Department of Physiology of the University of Auckland (2010-2011), School of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Queensland, Australia (2011-2013) and the College of Physics of the University of Exeter, UK (2013-2015). I founded my first independent research group in the Faculty of Biological Sciences in the University of Leeds, UK, in 2015 which led to a number of innovations in super-resolution microscopy methods including an enhanced version of Expansion Microscopy and a fast localisation microscopy method called sandSTORM. In 2019, I was awarded one of the prestigious, 7-year UKRI Future Leader Fellowships, which has led me to form the Applied Biophotonics Group in the School of Biosciences in the University of Sheffield where we are now working towards reimagining the way high-end optical microscopy can be performed and applied to a broad range of applications in the Life Sciences. 
In 2023, I moved to UNSW to take up the role of Head of Department of Molecular Medicine. Here started the new base for the Signalling Nanodomains Lab to build the newest phase of research into cardiac ryanodine receptors and their structural and functional organisation.
Adjacent to my scientific research, I work on advancing the equity, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I) in STEM. To this end, I write papers, advocate for marginalised people in science and advise on building inclusive research cultures in universities and funding organisations. Outside of my academic roles, I am interested in social and political issues, running, tech and Latin dance.
