  description: Coordinated events of calcium (Ca2+) released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are key second messengers in excitable cells. In pain-sensing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, these events can be observed as Ca2+ sparks, produced by a combination of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3R1). These microscopic signals offer the neuronal cells with a possible means of modulating the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ handling, initiating vesicular exocytosis. With super-resolution dSTORM and expansion microscopies, we visualised the nanoscale distributions of both RyR and IP3R1 that featured loosely organised clusters in the subplasmalemmal regions of cultured rat DRG somata. We adapted a novel correlative microscopy protocol to examine the nanoscale patterns of RyR and IP3R1 in the locality of each Ca2+ spark. We found that most subplasmalemmal sparks correlated with relatively small groups of RyR whilst larger sparks were often associated with larger groups of IP3R1. These data also showed spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in <30% of the subplasmalemmal cell area but consisted of both these channel species at a 3.8–5 times higher density than in nonactive regions of the cell. Taken together, these observations reveal distinct patterns and length scales of RyR and IP3R1 co-clustering at contact sites between the ER and the surface plasmalemma that encode the positions and the quantity of Ca2+ released at each Ca2+ spark.

  description: Rapid release of calcium from internal stores via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) is one of the fastest types of cytoplasmic second messenger signalling in excitable cells. In the heart, rapid summation of the elementary events of calcium release, 'calcium sparks', determine the contraction of the myocardium. We adapted a correlative super-resolution microscopy protocol to correlate sub-plasmalemmal spontaneous calcium sparks in rat right ventricular myocytes with the local nanoscale RyR2 positions. This revealed a steep relationship between the integral of a calcium spark and the sum of the local RyR2s. Segmentation of recurring spark sites showed evidence of repeated and triggered saltatory activation of multiple local RyR2 clusters. In myocytes taken from failing right ventricles, RyR2 clusters themselves showed a dissipated morphology and fragmented (smaller) clusters. They also featured greater heterogeneity in both the spark properties and the relationship between the integral of the calcium spark and the local ensemble of RyR2s. While fragmented (smaller) RyR2 clusters were rarely observed directly underlying the larger sparks or the recurring spark sites, local interrogation of the channel-to-channel distances confirmed a clear link between the positions of each calcium spark and the tight, non-random clustering of the local RyR2 in both healthy and failing ventricles.

  description: Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a versatile super-resolution microscopy pipeline, leveraging nanoscale biomolecular crosslinking and osmotically driven swelling of hydrogels. Currently, ExM is a laborious and skill-intensive technique, involving manual handling of the hydrogels that can compromise the integrity of the gels and capacity to track gel isotropy, hence diminishing reproducibility. We have developed a 3D-printable microplate system to contain the entire ExM workflow within each well, enabling in situ image acquisition and eliminating the need for direct handling of the hydrogels. The preservation of the gel geometry and orientation of the microplate wells enables convenient tracking of gel expansion, pre- and post-ExM image acquisition, and distortion mapping of every cell or region of interest. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with both single-color and multiplexed ExM of cultured HeLa cells and dissected pupal Drosophila melanogaster wing tissue to reveal distortion-prone structures ranging from sub-cellular organelles to micron-scale tissue regions.

  description: Amine-reactive esters of aromatic fluorescent dyes are emerging as imaging probes for nondescript staining of cellular and tissue architectures. We characterised the differential staining patterns of 14 fluorescent dye ester species with varying physical and spectral properties in the broadly studied human cell line – HeLa. When combined with expansion microscopy (ExM), these stains reveal nanoscale features such as the nuclear proteome, membrane-bound compartments and vesicles. Among N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, we observe differential compartment specificity and weighting of labelling density which correlates with the hydrophobicity of the dye ester. We also observe changes in both staining density and compartment specificity for a given dye ester depending on the presence of a second dye ester species and on the timepoint of application in the ExM protocol. Our findings confirm these dye esters as a useful addition to the repertoire of biomedical stains of the cellular proteome, either on their own, or as counterstains to immunofluorescence.

  description: Governments worldwide are committing more funding for scientific research in the face of the ongoing pandemic and climate crises. However, the funding process must be restructured to remove the barriers arising from conscious and unconscious biases experienced by minoritized groups, including women, and particularly women of colour. In this comment article, we outline the systemic barriers faced by women in STEM academic roles, the bottlenecks in funding and career opportunities, and more equitable and transparent approaches to reforming funding systems.
