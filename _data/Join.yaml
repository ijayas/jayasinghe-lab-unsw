  description: Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) impurities are a barrier for therapeutic use of mRNAs. DsRNA structures, present in RNA therapeutics, can induce a strong inflammatory response that limits the drugâ€™s efficacy, and this is especially true for therapeutics for chronic diseases. There is an increasing interest from regulatory agencies to demonstrate adequate dsRNA level control and current immunoassays used for dsRNA quantification show limited correlation between dsRNA structure detection and immunogenicity. In this project, the student will repurpose natural dsRNA sensors to establish an in-vitro/in-vivo assay for the quantitation of immunogenic dsRNA. The student will be trained on techniques and approaches to address structure-activity relationships of nucleic acid processing enzymes combining chemical biology and biophysical chemistry methods in solution with advanced imaging methods to quantify innate immune signalling activation in cells.
