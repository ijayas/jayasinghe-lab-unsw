  description: We seek a Research Associate/ Post-doctoral Fellow (Level A) on a 3-year project to lead multiplexed single molecule fluorescence imaging of heart tissues, cells and model cell assays. The objective of the position will include leveraging multiplexing capability of point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) to study combinations of molecular interactions in nanoscale signalling domains in cardiac muscle cells. For details, get in touch with PI, Dr Izzy Jayasinghe.
