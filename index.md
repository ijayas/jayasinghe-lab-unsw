# Visualising the systems of molecules in sub-cellular communication

We are a team of biomedical and biophysical scientists who harness the latest single molecule, optical, and omic technologies to study cell signalling. Our goal is to use our expertise in how signals are transdueced, particularly inside cells, to shed light on the mechanisms driving pathophysiologies such as heart disease, movement disorders, and pain. Towards this goal, we work on developing new methodologies that both we and our scientific community can utilise for advancing our understanding of disease and help drive the development of theraputic strategies.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Most physiologies and pathophysiologies can be traced down to the spatial organisation and physical interactions (in the form of structural or functional coupling) inside cells. We study signalling proteins in their organisation, chemical configuration, and partnering molecules in situ to understand their biology in their native environment. We use optical super-resolution mircroscopies to localise these proteins, alongside the dozens of key partner proteins in various cell types including muscle, neuronal and tumour cells.
